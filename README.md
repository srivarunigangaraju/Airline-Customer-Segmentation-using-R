# Airline-Customer-Segmentation-using-R
Performed clustering analysis on Airline Customers dataset to segment the groups as Frequent and Non-frequent flyers
using K-Means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms. Suggested different types of offers based on the customer analysis
<b>Cluster1 (Not so frequent Travellers):</b></br>
This is the largest cluster covering 63% of the total data. This include new customers and who don’t travel frequently(least flight miles in the last 12 months) and have the least qualify flight miles eligible for award travel. These people are also not using any of the credit cards frequently and are having least number of non flight bonus miles and bonus transactions. 

<b>Cluster2 (Loyal Customers): </b></br>
They are the oldest customers who have the highest number of days since enrolled . They use the frequent flyer credit card very often and have earned the maximum number of miles from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months. These account for 3.9% of the total customers. 

<b>Cluster3 (High Frequency Travellers):</b></br>
These customers travel very frequently. When compared to the other two segments, they have covered the maximum number flight miles making the most number of flight miles and flight transactions in the past 12 months. They also have the maximum number of miles counted as qualifying for Top Flight Status and maximum Balance miles among all the other clusters. This is the second largest cluster covering 31% of the total customers. 

<b>Cluster4(Medium Frequency travellers): </b></br>
This is the smallest cluster with 0.3% of all the customers and can be interpreted as medium frequency travellers.
